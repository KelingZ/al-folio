  abstract={Mortgage aggregators, e.g. Wells Fargo, buy mortgages from smaller originators and resell to government-sponsored agencies like Fannie Mae, channelling around 30 percent of mortgage funding from the secondary market to the primary market. I construct a novel dataset on aggregator-correspondent lender network unravelling mortgage aggregation activities. Using this novel merged dataset, I study the impact of mortgage aggregation on credit supply. Following a regulatory change that unexpectedly reduces aggregation volume, originators tied to aggregators reduce their origination, impacting low-income borrowers more. Imperfect substitution between funding sources amplifies origination reductions. My results quantify the role of mortgage aggregation in easing securitization frictions and highlight its role in ensuring credit access for low-income borrowers.}

  abstract={We propose a new conceptual framework for monetary policy transmission through shadow banks in the mortgage market that highlights the role of mortgage servicing in generating non-deposit funds for lending. We document that mortgage servicing acts as a natural hedge against interest rate shocks and dampens the effect of monetary policy on shadow bank mortgage lending. Higher interest rates reduce prepayment risk, increasing the collateral value of mortgage servicing assets and cashflow from servicing income. This enables shadow banks with greater exposure to mortgage servicing to obtain more funding. The mortgage servicing channel is weaker for traditional banks due to their reliance on deposit funding and the capital charge on mortgage servicing assets. Our estimates imply that the rising share of shadow banks in mortgage servicing has weakened the pass-through of monetary policy to aggregate mortgage lending.}

  author={Baldauf, Markus and Favilukis, Jack and Garlappi, Lorenzo and Zheng, Keling},

  conference={Presentations: Canadian Urban and Real Estate Summer Symposium 2022*},

  abstract={We provide the first analysis of U.S. Congress members’ real estate activity by combining their financial disclosures with property-level transactions. Active Congress members outperform average homeowners by 3.24% annually; they also outperform former members, financial professionals, and doctors. National-level market timing explains 30% of the outperformance, neighborhood-level explains 50%, and hyper-local or property-specific factors explain the remainder. A “buy-sell” index of Congress members’ transactions forecasts returns on the U.S. housing index. These findings suggest that superior information drives most of the outperformance. We fail to detect side-payments or bribery, however Federal transfers are higher to places where Congress members own.}

  title={Foreign Buyer Tax Impacts on Submarkets: Evidence from Canada},
  author={Davidoff, Thomas and Zheng, Keling},
  year={2023},
  conference={Presentations: UEA},
  abstract={We challenge the notion that foreign buyer tax improves housing affordability for locals. Leveraging transaction level data from Greater Vancouver Area in Canada, we find foreign buyer tax has limited price effects on low-value properties and condos. Estimating the separate effects of property hedonics, condo/single-family status, and propensity for foreign buying on the change in home prices before and after the tax, our findings reveal that, in the short run, foreign propensity explains the negative effects on high-value properties, although this relationship does not persist in the long run. Surprisingly, condo prices keep rising after the tax and foreign propensity fails to explain the effect. These results are consistent with a high degree of segmentation in Greater Vancouver: “filtering” of the price effects to lower-priced properties was quite limited.}

  title={How Do Nonbank Mortgage Lenders Shape Bank Small Business Lending?},
  author={Li, Xiyue and Lu, Dongliang and Zheng, Keling},
  year={2022},
  pdf={sbl.pdf},
  abstract={We investigate the impact of nonbank expansion in the mortgage market on bank’s lending portfolios. Employing a difference-in-differences approach based on regulatory changes that reduce nonbank lending costs, we find: 1) Nonbank expansion decreases bank mortgage market share amid no changes in total mortgage lending. 2) Diversified banks increase credit supply and offer lower rates to small business lending in counties with more nonbank expansion. 3) Within bank and county credit reallocation increases local small business entry and employment in the tradable sector. We develop a conceptual framework to show frictions in cross-county capital allocation drive the results. Our results highlight the distributional consequences of nonbank expansion in the small business lending market. }
